### This repo is about my teaching at the ReDi School of Digital Integration.

### I have created student-friendly material for https://redi-school.github.io/nrw-html-and-css/lesson12/

I have purposefully embedded CSS into HTML for the students' convenience.
 
 ### Please refer to the presentation https://github.com/dhananjayjm/CSS-Layout-Part-I/blob/master/Lesson%2012%20-%20CSS%20Layout%20-%20Part%20I.pptx

### Simply download or clone the repo to see the individual files and output.
